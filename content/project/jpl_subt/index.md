title: Hardware Intern JPL
summary: I contributed to the NAISR SOCOM Team by designing and maintaining sensor mounts for Spot payloads and integrating a State Machine structure for adaptive behavior switching. On the CoSTAR Nebula Team, I developed impact-protective foam solutions optimized for weight, visibility, and thermal performance, supporting the DARPA SubT Competition.
