title: Collaborative Robotics (ME326)
summary: The goal of this project is for two robots to collaborate for a resource gathering task without the use of digital communication.
        Teams will then need to construct the pattern built by the other team by visually observing their
        gathering and replicating it on their side of the line under the second Apriltag.
