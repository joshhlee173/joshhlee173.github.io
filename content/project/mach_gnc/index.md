title: GNC Internship Mach Industries
summary: Developed a Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) stack to enable precise aircraft navigation in GNSS-denied environments. By refining the Extended Kalman Filter for optimal sensor fusion and integrating data from IMUs, airspeed, and altitude sensors, I contributed to reliable state estimation, conducted high-fidelity simulations, and identified key improvements for real-world flight tests, laying the foundation for future iterations of the system.
