title: N+1 Cabled Robotic Arm Salisbury
summary: develop a lightweight robotic arm with mechanically variable stiffness. It is intended for use in physical human/robot interactions.
        The design employs a cabled transmission to allow the actuators to be placed at the base of the arm rather than at the joints, minimizing moving mass.
